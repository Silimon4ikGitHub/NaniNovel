{name}: You can call me {name}
Skofild.Default: (Speaking in a hushed tone) OK {name}, these guards are starting to eye us suspiciously. We should make ourselves scarce before they become too curious.

{name}:  Aye, i think too. Their gaze tells me they'll soon be looking for more than a simple conversation. What's your scheme then?
Skofild.Default: Ever noticed the back door, where the refuse is carried out?
{name}: Yes, what of it?
Skofild.Default: The sewer passage. We might slip away unnoticed through the filth and the grime. Guards are none too fond of such places.
{name}: And how do you suggest we navigate the foul sewers?
Skofild.Default: We'll need a stout rope to avoid being caught in the mire. Can you buy one from the market stall in the room opposit?
{name}: Aye, I'll do it. But be quick and don't arouse their suspicions.
