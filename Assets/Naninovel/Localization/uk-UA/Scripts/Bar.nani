; 	Skofild.Default: (Speaking in a hushed tone) OK {myName}, these guards are starting to eye us suspiciously. We should make ourselves scarce before they become too curious.

# b1cd171d
; 	{myName}:  Aye, i think too. Their gaze tells me they'll soon be looking for more than a simple conversation. What's your scheme then?

# a5329f90
; 	Skofild.Default: Ever noticed the back door, where the refuse is carried out?

# f2dc4175
; 	{myName}: Yes, what of it?

# 485a2aa7
; 	Skofild.Default: The sewer passage. We might slip away unnoticed through the filth and the grime. Guards are none too fond of such places.

# fc86f450
; 	{myName}: And how do you suggest we navigate the foul sewers?

# fd2786f0
; 	Skofild.Default: We'll need a stout rope to avoid being caught in the mire. Can you buy one from the market stall in the room opposit?

# f774eb94
; 	{myName}: Aye, I'll do it. But be quick and don't arouse their suspicions.

# 181f62fa
; 	Guard1.Default: Skofild, you're under arrest for thievery and conspiracy. Surrender peacefully, and this won't get messy.

# 76b2c6c3
; 	Skofild.Default: You've got the wrong man. I'm innocent of whatever you're accusing me of.

# c928c15f
; 	Guard2.Default: Save it for the magistrate. You're coming with us.

# 2b5fc812
; 	{myName}: (whispering to Skofild) We need a plan. Going quietly might not be our best option.

# 9ee0db22
; 	Skofild.Default: (whispering back) We'll play along for now. We don't want a brawl in these tight quarters.
