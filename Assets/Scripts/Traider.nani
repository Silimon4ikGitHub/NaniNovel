Traid.Default: Greetings, kind sir! How might I be of service to you on this fine day?
{myName}: Good day to you, good trader! I am in need of a sturdy rope for a task.
Traid: A rope, you say? It so happens that among my array of wares, there lies a sturdy coil of rope. However, it isn't for sale, but I'll make you an offer.
{myName}: An offer? I'm intrigued. What might it be?
Traid: If you can seek out the hidden rope amongst my goods, you're welcome to have it without any cost. Consider it a bit of fun, and a challenge, if you will.
{myName}: A hidden rope, you say?
